   Variable is Nothing but It act like a container which store the value in it also we say that it allocate the memory location
   to store program data to it 
   
   in java have diffrent type of varible
   
    String 		- stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
	int		    - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
	float 		- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
	char 		- stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
	boolean 	- stores values with two states: true or false
	
	
	syntax
		type variableName = value;
	
	Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable 
    (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.
