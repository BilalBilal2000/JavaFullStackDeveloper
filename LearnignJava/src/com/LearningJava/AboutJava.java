/*
	  Java is a widely-used programming language for coding web applications.
	  
	  Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, 
	  in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.
	  
	  
	   Initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 
	  (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
	  
	  
	  Feature of Java: The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, 
	  Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, 
	  Object-Oriented, Interpreted,and Dynamic"
	  
	  
	  James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. 
	  The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
  
  
  
    1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
       1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
   
    2) Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.

	3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
	
	4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project.
	5) Why Oak? Oak is a symbol of strength and chosen as a national tree of many countries like the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.
	
	6) In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.
